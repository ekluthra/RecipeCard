        <h4>Welcome to the RecipePage Library
            <br>
            This is a library that allows developers to
            create customizable, simple cards catered to displaying information about recipes. 
            <br>
            The developer is able to create cards, which contain a recipe title, an image, a list of ingredients, tags, and
            a description (which is on the back or front of the card).
            <br>
            RecipePage is useful for developers who want to:
            <ul style="list-style-type:none;">
                <li>Run a blog where they post about their recipes and would like an easy way to display them </li>
                <li>Log recipes they have tried to keep track of what they have already made/what they want to make</li>
                <li>Host a recipe suggestion website, where users can enter the information needed to create a RecipePage card (i.e. filling out a form, upon which the recipe they just entered will be
                made into a card), somewhat like an open source recipe library.</li>
            <ul>
            <br>

        <span>Please note that it is best to use the Chrome browser for this library, as some animations will be unavailable or buggy with other browsers, such as Opera, Safari, Internet Explorer, and Brave</span><br><br>
        <span>This is an example of a basic flippable card, with no tags. This is a simple way of declaring a RecipePage The developer can choose to simply pass in the mandatory arguments at first, (width, height, ... , parent) and then later on, set the rest of the elements with built-in functions. This allows for a smaller makeCard function call, keeping the code cleaner and easier to read.</span>
        <br>
        <div class="code-block">
        
            <code>
                const rp = new RecipePage() // defining a new RecipePage object <br>
                rp.makeCard(300, 340, '#FFF7DD', '', [],"","", [], 'example1') <br>
                rp.setTitle('Chicken Parmasean') <br>
                rp.setImage('https://secret-sands-52672.herokuapp.com/images/chicken-parmesan.jpg') <br>
                rp.addIngredients(['Chicken Breast', 'Spaghetti', 'Tomato Sauce', 'Mozarella Cheese', 'Cilantro']) <br>
                rp.setDescription('First, boil your noodles for 10 minutes or until al dente. While the noodles boil, heat up a saucepan on medium\
                -high and throw in your tomato sauce, chicken breast, and cilantro. Drain and pour the noodles into the saucepan and mix to coat. this isnt a real\
                recipe I just made this up last minute') <br>

        <span>This is an example of a basic flippable card, with two tags: spicy and vegetarian. Here is another way to make a RecipePage, which passes in all the arguments at once if preferred.</span>
        <br>
        <div class="code-block">
            <code>
                const rp2 = new RecipePage() <br>
                rp2.makeCard(400, 460, '#5F9EA0', 'Spicy Korean Tofu', ['Tofu', 'Gochujang sauce', 'Brown sugar', 'Soy sauce', 'Frozen veggies', 'Garlic', 'Onion'],
                'Sautee the tofu until lightly browned, or bake for 15 minutes. Mix sugar, soy sauce, gochujang sauce, and some water. Cook garlic and onion. Throw in tofu and sauce.', 'https://www.maangchi.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/dubujorim-insta.jpg', ['spicy', 'vegetarian'], 'example2')

        <span>This is an example of a non-flippable card, with no tags. This final example is of a non-flippable card, meaning that 
        the last parameter is false, and you cannot flip the card on the
        DOM, so the description of the recipe is on the front of the card</span>

            <code>
                const rp3 = new RecipePage() <br>

Pour onto cooked chicken', 'https://secret-sands-52672.herokuapp.com/images/butter-chicken.jpg', ['spicy'], 'example3', false)

        <p>The button below will set a theme for all your cards, making them all the same color. I've hardcoded it to change to '#b3b3ff', but a developer would be able to call the function setTheme({color}) anytime they need to set a theme to the cards.</p><br>
